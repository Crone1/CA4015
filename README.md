# Project Explanation
This repository contains work we did on clustering data related to decision making in the college module *'Advanced Machine Learning'*.

This project was based around data from a model on participant decision making in the Iowa Gambling Task. This task revolves around four decks of cards with each deck giving the participant a reward or a penalty. The participants are given the task of maximising their reward and told to play the game a fixed amount of times.
After these participants were finished, their decisions were modeled and the parameters for the model for each user was stored. Our project focused on clustering the users into groups based on their values for these model parameters.

# Viewing our Jupyter Book
We have created a Jupyter Book to make it easy to view our documentation and our code for this project, the steps to access this are as follows:
 - Extract *'CA4015_Assignment_1.zip'* to a local folder,
 - Within the extracted folder, navigate to the *'_build folder'*,
 - Within the *'_build folder'*, navigate to the *'_html folder'*,
 - Double Click on *'index.html'* to launch our jupyter book in your default browser.
